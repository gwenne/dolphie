# dolphie
chatbot for small talk


This is the README doco file for my Dolphie project

This is a simple single page website that allows visitor to chat to an intelligent chatbot.

This system is interfacing with the chatbot through API requests.

I called him "Dolphie" because we all know Dolphins are real smart creatures and Dolphie is from the dolphin family.
